Undergraduate students at MIT interested in UROP opportunities should contact our current UROP coordinators at [rrg-urops@mit.edu](mailto:rrg-urops@mit.edu).

Prospective graduate students should apply to the grad program in a relevant department at MIT and mention our lab in your application. We are an interdisciplinary lab, and have worked with students from a variety of departments at MIT, including (but not limited to) the EECS, AeroAstro, and MechE departments, and from the MIT-WHOI Joint Program. 

Interested in graduate studies, but not sure where to start with the application process? A number of MIT departments have Graduate Application Assistance Programs (GAAP), programs, that are designed to support prospective students through the application process. You can find more information about the programs [here.](https://oge.mit.edu/community-diversity/prospective-students/graduate-application-assistance-programs-gaap/)
