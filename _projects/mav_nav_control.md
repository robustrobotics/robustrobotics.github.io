Our group has developed some of the first fully autonomous micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) systems capable of self-directed exploration in both GPS-Denied and communications-denied environments. The absence of GPS and high-bandwidth communications links limits the sensing and processing available to the MAV to only that which can be carried onboard the vehicle.

An example of our past work includes a fixed wing vehicle capable of localizing itself in a known map and flying autonomously using only a 2D laser scanner and inertial measurement unit (IMU), with all processing performed onboard the vehicle.

Our recent work has focused on using small, inexpensive cameras to estimate the pose of the MAV and the geometric structure of the environment to enable high-speed autonomous flight.
