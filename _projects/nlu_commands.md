Natural language is an intuitive and flexible modality for human-robot interaction. A robot designed to interact naturally with humans must be able to understand instructions without requiring the person to speak in any special way. We are building systems that robustly understand natural language commands produced by untrained users. We have applied our work to understanding spatial language commands for a robotic wheelchair, a robotic forklift, as well as a micro-air vehicle.
