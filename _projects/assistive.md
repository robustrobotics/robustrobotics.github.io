We are developing planning and learning algorithms that can be used to optimize awheelchair dialogue manager for a human-robot interaction system. The long-term goal of this research is to develop intelligent assistive technology, such as a robotic wheelchair, that can be used easily by an untrained population. We are working with the residents and staff of The Boston Home, a specialized care residence for adults with advanced multiplesclerosis and other progressive neurological diseases, to develop an intelligent interface to the residents' wheelchairs. An adaptive, intelligent dialogue manager will be essential for allowing a diverse population with a variety of physical and communication impairments to interact with the system.
